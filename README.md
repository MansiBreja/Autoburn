## Car agency- a C++ project

### Car agencies have to deal with a lot of customers daily. Hence it is very important to maintain records of all the customers. For this purpose, we require a procedure that makes it easier to maintain the customerâ€™s details so that the records of various customers can be stored.
#### In this project-" CAR AGENCY-A C++ PROJECT" operations like adding new cars to the existing stock of cars, maintaining records of sales of cars ,keeping  records of customer's details and completing orders on company side have been incorporated.

## Description:

#### The aim of the project is to provide a one-stop solution to the owner of the car agency, enabling him to maintain all details at one place.
#### The code provides 2 interfaces:
1. Work related to company's side.
2. Work related to customers.

- The code consists of a linked list which is used to maintain the records of existing cars in the store. Functions providing operations like adding new cars to the existing stock, displaying the details of existing stock of cars to the customer when the order is being placed and deletion of records of cars from the availability list, when the orders are completed, have been implemented.
- It also consists of a queue to provide a just service on first come first served basis. The orders placed by the customers along with their details are added to the end of the queue and the completion of orders takes place from the beginning of the queue .
- A stack has also been used to maintain the sale records of cars as well as the details of corresponding customers because of its basic application providing last in and first out service.

#### When the code is run, a drop down menu provides the 2 basic operations:
#### 1.Work related to company's side.
It consists of options namely:
1. Add a new car.
2. Display of sales records.
3. Exit. (which will exit from this menu)

#### 2. Work related to customers.
It consists of options namely:
1. Taking order.	
2. Completing order.
3. Exit. (which will exit from this menu)

#### 3. Exit. (which will exit from the main menu)

## Conclusion:
The project is very useful in maintaining the records of existing stock of cars and sales records along with customer details.
The project when implemented successfully can be used to reduce the work load of car agency manager efficiently.
